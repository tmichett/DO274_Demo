[student@workstation URL_Check_Demo]$ ansible-rulebook -r url_check.yml -i inventory

[NOTE]
=====
You must first run the *Setup_Demo.sh* script to ensure all pieces are available. Then you can run the rulebook command. To demonstrate both conditions and fixes, you will need to have a separate window open and delete the *index.html* file and *systemctl stop httpd*.
