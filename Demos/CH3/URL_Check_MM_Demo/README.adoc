= Running the Demo

The demo for URL Check Mattermost will launch a rulebook locally on workstation which is similar to Chapter 1. However, this rulebook will notify Mattermost with an error message for the website being down because the service is stopped or because the index.html file is missing.

The demo also utilizes EDA controller as a listener that will listen for events from MatterMost and kick off another set of tasks which integrate with Ansible Automation Controller to run a playbook based on the given events. The playbook will then trigger another notification to Mattermost that the event has been resolved.

.Webhook and Mattermost Trigger Phrases

* *website-index-fix*: Used to trigger EDA controller which calls a job on Automation Controller to repair the index.html file and notifiy Mattermost that job is fixed.

* *website-service-fix*: Used to trigger EDA controller which calls a job on Automation Controller to repair the services (systemctl restart httpd) and notifiy Mattermost that job is fixed.

[NOTE]
=====
You must first run the *Setup_Demo.sh* script to ensure all pieces are available. Then you can run the rulebook command. To demonstrate both conditions and fixes, you will need to have a separate window open and delete the *index.html* file and *systemctl stop httpd*.

It is also necessary to configure the WebHooks for Mattermost and ensure they are correct in the playbooks.

.Incoming Webhooks

Incoming webhooks are needed so that Mattermost can receive events and notifications from EDA Controller and rulebooks. This webhook needs to be updated in the playbooks to ensure that they are triggered correctly.

*Incoming Webhook Playbooks*

* *website_notify_down.yml*
* *website_notify_missing_index.yml*

*System Console => Environment => Developer => Allow Untrusted connections* and enter in EDA controller and the 172.25.250.0/24 subnet.

You also need to setup the WebHook *Integrations => Incoming Webhooks*

image::images/README-24-05-15-14-50-20.png[title="Webhook URL", align="center"]

The *incoming webhook* gets created by the start and setup script, just copy the webhook and place in the playbooks above.

.Outgoing Webhooks

The outgoing webhooks must be configured so that Mattermost can connect and contact the EDA Controller based on the service needed.

*Outgoing Webhook Playbooks*

* *website_notify_down.yml*
* *website_notify_missing_index.yml*

[IMPORTANT]
=====
It is very important that if you are using Rulebooks with the *run_playbook* command that the inventory/host specified in the ruleset is the same host as specified in the playbooks, otherwise, there are issues with *no hosts matched*.

=== Setup for the Demo

. Run the setup script to prepare the environment.

[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation ~]$  cd /home/student/Github/DO274_Demo/Demos/CH3/URL_Check_MM_Demo
----

----
+
The *Setup_Demo.sh* script prepares the lab environment and also calls the *_lab start example-chat_* script to setup and pre-configure MatterMost and some of the server configuration settings there.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=====
The *Setup_Demo.sh* script takes about five (5) minutes to run to completion.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
This webhook will hopefully be the same and no change would need to be made to the playbooks. If that is the case, we are just verifying. However, if a change needs to be made to the webhook, it should be copied and applied to the playbook.

The playbooks that would need to be modified are located in the DO274_Demo project and would not need to be updated in Github.

[TIP]
=====
The process can be repeated for the *httpd* service. In order to test the service triggers, run *systemctl stop httpd* on serverA and to fix the service, type *website-service-fix* in Mattermost.

It is also important that again, the URLs might need changed for the incoming webhooks. If this is the case, please submit an issue as I can turn this into a variable for Ansible Automation Controller as there is no direct "commit" access for my main branch. Another solution would be to "fork" the repository and make it your own.

Playbooks that need to be modified for the Ansible Automation Controller are in the *DO274 Demo Project* which belong to the https://github.com/tmichett/AAP2_Demos.git repository.

.Playbooks to modify the URL for MatterMost Incoming Webhook
* website_notify_index_restored.yml
* website_notify_service_restored.yml

The Webhook being used should be part of the course, but it may change with course updates.

== Repositories and Items in Demo

There are several public repositories used in this demo. The reason these needed to be used is based on the project structure, file locations, and because they are also shared resources in other courses.
